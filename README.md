# Task2
My Task2 is on Computer Vision

Computer Vision is considered to be the most trending aspect in the field of Computer Science and its applications. As we look back into the records of last few decades in Computer Science, we can see Computer Vision has gotten a higher amount of involvement as it is inextricably engaged in advancement of computerized world.With Computer Vision, one can develop security cameras, detect some objects and its movements, can detect object color, expertise a self driving car and there are so many of them.

In this project, I have developed a Machine which can detect the color of individual pixels inside a picture.For this, I have taken a csv file which stores the name, hexadecimal code and RGB value of each individual color exisiting. I have used a picture to demonstrate the coding part. 

I got the benefits of using python where I can click on the image and the my code will generate the expected color name with its corresponding RGB value. The mouse-click features are predefined in python and there are so many events of it. it gives the corresponding x and y coordinate of dimension I clicked and related RGB value of that particular pixel of the image.

Happy Coding, Thanks.
